> 摘要: A method of measuring realism in **confidence judgments** related to a variety of tasks—perception, motor performance, recall, etc.—and information is set out; realism being equated with the ability to assign probability of outcome with **accuracy**. Direct verbal estimates are made comparing performance with expectancy at all points along a scale with a **resulting index** of realism. Difficulties in this method relate to the need for independent criteria of accuracy of the information or task and the large number of decisions which must be made before an index is obtained. Implications relate to training in realism, transfer of this training to different classes of conditions, and the study of a given individual's systematic distortions.
